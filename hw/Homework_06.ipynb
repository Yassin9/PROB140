    "### Recommendation ###\n",
    "**Don't start this homework early. Use it as an opportunity to assess your preparation for the upcoming midterm. First complete the bulk of your review for the exam. After your review, set aside all course materials, find a place where you can work on your own, and give yourself 75 minutes to do the assignment. The problems that you are not able to do in that time will give you an indication of where you need to focus the remaining portion of your review.**"
