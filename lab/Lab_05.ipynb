    "Cryptography is the study of algorithms used to encode and decode messages. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been successfully used to decode messages encrypted using substitution codes and also [more complex](http://probability.ca/jeff/ftpdir/decipherart.pdf) encryption methods. In this lab you will apply MCMC and the Metropolis algorithm to decode English text that has been encrypted by a substitution code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab is based on the paper [The Markov Chain Monte Carlo Revolution](https://math.uchicago.edu/~shmuel/Network-course-readings/MCMCRev.pdf) by [Persi Diaconis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persi_Diaconis). It was presented at the 25th anniversary celebrations of MSRI up the hill, and appeared in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society in November 2008. The code is based on [Simulation and Solving Substitution Codes](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~sbc502/decode.pdf) written by [Stephen Connor](https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/staff/stephen-connor/) in 2003.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in class we worked with a tiny alphabet and a short message that had been encoded using a substitution code. We used a Markov chain model and a scoring system to choose the decoder that had the highest score. That is, we chose the decoder that had the highest likelihood given the message. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the alphabet was small, we were able to list all the decoders and their corresponding scores. When the alphabet is large, making an exhaustive list of all possible decoders and scores is not feasible. That's where the Monte Carlo part of the algorithm comes in. The idea is to choose decoders at random using an algorithm that favors good decoders over bad ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will work with an alphabet consisting of all 26 English letters as well as a space character that will have a special status. Before you begin, please review Sections [11.3](http://prob140.org/textbook/Chapter_11/03_Code_Breaking.html) (Code Breaking) and [11.4](http://prob140.org/textbook/Chapter_11/04_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo.html) (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) of the textbook. The lab follows those sections closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike all the other labs, this lab is not divided into parts. It's just one small project. You will learn how to:\n",
    "- Apply a decoder to encoded text\n",
    "- Use transformations for improved numerical accuracy\n",
    "- Implement the Metropolis algorithm \n",
    "- Decode a message encrypted by a substitution code\n",
    "\n",
    "The programming needed for this lab is more complex than what can reasonably be expected based on just Data 8 background, so much of it has been done for you. Those of you who have more extensive Python knowledge might be interested in looking at the details.\n",

    "*  Scan all the pages into a PDF. You can use any scanner or a phone using an application. Please **DO NOT** simply take pictures using your phone. \n",
    "* Please start a new page for each question. If you have already written multiple questions on the same page, you can crop the image or fold your page over (the old-fashioned way). This helps expedite grading.\n",

    "* Submit the assignment to Lab 5 on Gradescope. \n",
