    "- The `stats` and `special` modules of SciPy make it easy to compute probabilities numerically.\n",
    "- Counting isn't always as easy as 1-2-3; you have to be careful to avoid double counting or leaving out elements that should be counted.\n",
    "- Shapes of hypergeometric distributions can vary quite markedly depending on the parameters.\n",
    "- The joint distribution of two variables is simply a probability distribution over pairs of outcomes. Using it to find a probability works the same way as with one variable: identify the outcomes in the event and add up their chances.\n",
    "- Noticing symmetry and equality in distribution can reduce the amount of calculation needed."
