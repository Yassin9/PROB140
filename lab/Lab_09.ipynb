    "## Part 1: Arrival Counts ##\n",
    "To start off, you will examine how the Poisson distribution arises out of a simple set of assumptions about the process of arrivals. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Rate ###\n",
    "The process has a numerical parameter $\\lambda > 0$ that is the expected number of arrivals per unit time. The arrivals are random, of course, so there will most likely be different numbers of arrivals in successive units of time. You can think of $\\lambda$ as an average over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher $\\lambda$ is, the more arrivals you expect per unit time. So $\\lambda$ is called the *intensity* of the process, or the *arrival rate*, which is usually shortened to just *rate*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our code, we will use `lam` for $\\lambda$ because `lambda` has a different meaning in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the rate is a constant, not a function of time. That is, the intensity of arrivals is the same at all times. Under this assumption the process is called *time-homogeneous* or just *homogeneous*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should only use this model in situations where the assumption of homogeneity is reasonable. You would not want to assume time homogeneity in situations where the intensity of arrivals varies over time. For example, If you are modeling people arriving at the ticket counter of a movie theater, you might expect more crowding right before movie start times than at other times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discretizing the Arrival Times ###\n",
    "To understand the process in continuous time, it helps to create a discrete approximation. \n",

It includes the use of the homogeneous Poisson process to model times of earthquakes in California. It's not surprising that the model might be an over-simplification; see for example this [lecture](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Seminars/psu10.pdf) by Prof. [Philip Stark](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/) of Berkeley's Statistics department. However, it's OK as a rough starting point, and you can use it to make some rough predictions.\n",

    "*  Scan all the pages into a PDF. You can use any scanner or a phone using an application. Please **DO NOT** simply take pictures using your phone. \n",
    "* Please start a new page for each question. If you have already written multiple questions on the same page, you can crop the image or fold your page over (the old-fashioned way). This helps expedite grading.\n",

    "### Code Portion ###\n",
    "* Save your notebook using File > Save and Checkpoint.\n",
    "* Generate a PDF file using File > Download as > PDF via LaTeX. This might take a few seconds and will automatically download a PDF version of this notebook.\n",
    "    * If you have issues, please make a follow-up post on the general Lab 9 Piazza thread.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Submitting ###\n",
    "* Combine the PDFs from the written and code portions into one PDF.  [Here](https://smallpdf.com/merge-pdf) is a useful tool for doing so. \n",
    "* Submit the assignment to Lab 9 on Gradescope. \n",
